# Custom sentences and intents in Home Assistant

There are good reasons for wanting to use custom sentences and intents in Home Assistant.

* A built-in sentence may not exist yet
* The built-in sentence may not return the exact response you are looking for
* You may want to send the response to a speaker other than the one in your Voice Assistant device
* Custom sentences give more control over input than sentence triggers in an automation

Documentation exists for [custom sentence syntax](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/template-sentence-syntax/), but there is very little for intents. They are referred to as [Intent scripts](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/intent_script/) but they are actually an odd mixture of script and template.

This repository aims to provide a few working examples.
